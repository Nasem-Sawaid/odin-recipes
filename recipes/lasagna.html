    <p>
      Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the
      oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish
      is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as
      ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.
